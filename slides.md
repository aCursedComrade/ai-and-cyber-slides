notes:

- So, AI is the big talk of the industry right now
- Remember Web 3 being the hype before that, 2019
- IoT, decentralized web and cloud services was the hype even before that
- Looking at AI, its surprising to see how far the industry has *innovated* in 2 two years
- DISCLAIMER : I do not know much about the technical aspects AI and ML

# What is "AI"?

TL;DR : Funny math functions that can do smart stuff (joke)

---

Algorithms trained on data that can be adapted to different scenarios to automate things.

Vendors provide generic AI models, variety of use cases but no specialty. These can be trained on specific data that are tailored to special use cases so they can perform better.

---

AI can usually be smart search engines because they can be used to parse ==unorganized data== quickly and extract useful information out from that data.

Just hope its *not* hallucinating.

---

The quality depends on how large the AI model is (number of parameters and supported context) and in the past couple of years, the consumer-grade models have gotten larger and larger.

---

The quality of training data also matters. Most data on the internet can be used with an AI model to answer common problems. But, as the topic gets more complex, it gets harder to train these models and receive a correct output.

...which means you can "hack" them.

What happens when the training data gets *poisoned?*

Jail breaking.

Remember [ChatGPT's alter ego, DAN (TheGuardian)](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/08/chatgpt-alter-ego-dan-users-jailbreak-ai-program-to-get-around-ethical-safeguards)?

There are practical uses for this, more on this later.

AI can be distracted too: Prompt injections.

# Use cases in Cyber

## Attack & Defense

## How do <u>good guys</u> use them?

Most defense teams utilize these by ingesting it with streams of events. They can use these models, even generic, to enrich the data tied to events and then feed them to defense platforms like EDR.

notes:

Local researchers and professionals have been on the same topic as well. A project based on reinforcement learning called Smart Shield was presented in the recent BSides Sri Lanka conference as well.

---

It is seen to be used in vulnerability research as well. Researchers use these models as an automation tools during fuzzing stages and to dig up useful information related to the target they are currently researching on.

---

Due to the sensitive nature of vulnerability research, most generic models are trained *not* to converse on these topics. This has lead to **jail breaking** models so it can provide rather sensitive information that a platform may ban.

Some examples being **WormGPT** and **Kali GPT**. But, jail breaking is more old school now.

---

Nowadays, the industry seems to adopt more open-source models. These are often dubbed as =="uncensored" models== with little to no guardrails which can be hosted and used outside proprietary platforms. These provide a good base to train for specific use cases as discussed before.

However, with such unrestricted capabilities, it means that it can be used nefarious purposes. Which brings us to...

Talk about the content that we start to see in popular platforms, memes and "AI slop"

It is obvious that the Internet has seen a noticeable shift since the publicity of GenAI.

Unintentionally (or intentionally), usage of AI has opened up new attack vectors that seemed crazy before.

Straight out of sci-fi stories.

Even the incapable threat actor could easily trap an average person with these capabilities.

Majority of people outside technical space can be fooled by these techniques.

# AI: Friend or Foe?

---

It depends.

---

Its a tool that has the potential to enhance humans, maximize its usage appropriately to do good and meaningful work.

---

My advice for the future:

- Trust but verify. Fact checking is key.
- Educate the uneducated. Spread awareness is more important than before.
- The hype will die but the tooling will remain, focusing on tackling real problem.
- Respect the tooling you have access to, there is a lot of power in them.

---

#### Educate yourself first, human intelligence is key to everything.
